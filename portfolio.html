                            In an introductory coding class I took in spring of 
                            2022, CSCE 111, I created a website for a class 
                            assignment. The assignment was to include information 
                            about myself, my travels, and an interesting project
                            I've completed. <a href="csce111/index.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to my old website!

                        <p>
                            In the fall of 2022, I completed a seam-carving project. 
                            Given starter code, I implemented functions that traversed 
                            a PPM file. The program found lines of pixels, vertical or 
                            horizontal, that had the least change. The seams were 
                            removed, and the carved image file was returned.

                        To further my understanding of different APIs, I want to create a 
                        program that works with Spotify. My goal is to take 
                        in a user's Spotify listening information from a certain period of 
                        time and analyze the songs and genres listened to by the user. 
                        This well help me gain experience working with different types of data.

                        This project would serve as an application that is an automated 
                        to-do list. The user would put in their chores and frequency in 
                        which they must be completed, and the application would then send 
                        reminders when it is time to complete the tasks. The application 
                        would keep track of when chores are completed or delayed. These 
                        statistics would then be saved and analyzed so the user can be 
                        kept accountable.
