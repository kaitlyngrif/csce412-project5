                        Howdy! I'm Kaitlyn Griffin. I am a Junior at Texas A&M University 
                        currently majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In high school I was involved in UIL academics. I explored my interests 
                        through my involvement in UIL spelling, computer science, number sense, 
                        and science. I was on the competing team for computer science my junior 
                        year of high school. Participating in these activities caused me to 
                        realize that I am passionate about STEM and problem-solving. I entered 
                        college as a biology major, but I soon realized that my true calling was 
                        elsewhere. After spending a year as a biology major, I changed my major 
                        and transferred to computer science. This was the right choice for me, 
                        and I have found where my genuine interests lie. 
                    </p>

                        In the summer of 2023, I went on a study abroad trip to Greece to take 
                        CSCE 411. The course focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms. 
                        During my time abroad I was able to overcome new challenges in an 
                        unknown environment and expand my world-view.  It was a transformative 
                        experience that reinforced my passion for computer science and 
                        problem-solving. It also helped me understand the ways in which computer 
                        science is involved in many different fields across the globe.

                    <p>
                        I am interested in machine learning, data science, and databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am always looking for ways to increase my involvement in the community on campus. 
                        I am the Director of Technology in my sorority, <a href="http://aggieaoe.com">Alpha Omega Epsilon</a>, 
                        a professional women's sorority. Additionally, I'm also involved with 
                        <a href="https://aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a>. Through my participation in ACC, 
                        I intend to further build and strengthen my coding and collaboration skills.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I continue to pursue my education and grow as a student and individual, 
                        I look forward to embracing new challenges, building strong connections, 
                        and making a meaningful impact on the world.
                    </p>

                        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
