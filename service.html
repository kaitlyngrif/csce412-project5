                            In the past I have volunteered at my local library, 
                            <a href="https://countylibrary.org/malcolm">Malcolm Purvis Library</a>.
                            I typiclaly helped in preparing activities by setting up rooms 
                            for events and cutting out and organizing paper for activities for children.

                        <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Games Done Quick</a> is a speedrun marathon that 
                        holds speedrunning marathons throughout the year to raise money for various charities. 
                        The two main events are Awesome Games Done Quick, usually held in early January, and 
                        Summer Games Done Quick, which is typically held at some point between May and July. 
                        Both events last for seven days and are streamed to a live audience. Awesome Games 
                        Done Quick raises money for the 
                        <a href="https://www.preventcancer.org/">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>, and Summer 
                        Games Done Quick raises money for 
                        <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a>. In total, 
                        GDQ has raised over $46,000,000 for charity. Personally, I've watched GDQ's events since 
                        January of 2019 when I was introduced to AGDQ by my older brother.
